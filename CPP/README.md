# C++ Modules 

This repository contains the C++ modules from the 42 curriculum, focused on building strong foundations in object-oriented programming and modern C++ practices.

The projects cover core C++ syntax, class design, constructors and destructors, the Rule of Three, memory management, inheritance, and encapsulation. They also introduce compile-time and runtime polymorphism through function overloading, virtual functions, abstract classes, and base-class pointers.
