# NetPractice

## Description

**NetPractice** is a networking training project from the 42 curriculum designed to build a strong practical understanding of fundamental computer networking concepts.

The goal of the project is to correctly configure network topologies by assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and routing rules so that multiple hosts can communicate with each other and with the Internet. Rather than focusing on programming, NetPractice emphasizes **network logic, packet forwarding, and routing decisions**.

Through a series of progressively challenging levels, the project develops a clear understanding of how hosts, switches, routers, and gateways interact within TCP/IP networks.

## Instructions

### Running the Training Interface

1. Download the file attached to the project’s page.
2. Extract the files into any folder of your choice.
3. In the extracted folder, run:
4. The NetPractice interface should open in your web browser (Firefox or Chromium recommended).

---

### Using the Interface

There are two buttons available in the interface:

- **[Check again]**  
Verifies whether the current network configuration is correct or not.

- **[Get my config]**  
Downloads the configuration file for the current level.

Each level must be validated and exported individually.

---

### Submission Requirements

- **10 configuration files** must be submitted.
- Each configuration file corresponds to **one completed level**.
- All 10 exported configuration files must be placed **at the root of the Git repository**.
- No additional files are required unless explicitly stated.

## Networking Concepts Covered

This project covers and reinforces the following networking concepts:

- TCP/IP addressing
- IPv4 subnetting and CIDR notation
- Subnet masks
- Default gateway
- Routing tables and next-hop logic
- Static routing
- Routers vs switches
- Host vs network device roles
- Packet forwarding
- OSI Model concepts (especially Layer 2 and Layer 3)

## Resources

### Networking References

- *TCP/IP Illustrated* — W. Richard Stevens  
- RFC 791 — Internet Protocol (IPv4)  
- RFC 950 — Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure  
- Cisco Networking Basics Documentation  
- OSI Model Overview (ISO/IEC 7498-1)  
- Subnetting and CIDR tutorials

### AI Usage

AI tools (such as ChatGPT) were used strictly as **learning and clarification aids** to:
- Understand networking concepts such as routing, gateways, subnetting, and packet flow
- Troubleshoot configuration errors and interpret validation feedback
- Improve conceptual understanding of router and host behavior

All configurations and final solutions were completed manually by the student. AI assistance was not used to automatically generate solutions, but only to support learning and comprehension.

## Notes

NetPractice requires thinking in terms of **network paths and routing decisions** rather than isolated configurations. Each solution depends on understanding how packets move step by step through interfaces, routing tables, and gateways.
